Introduced Silman Colab, Computational design Research Group at Silman TYLin and my current work on Optimizing a Structural 
Truss System for Cross-section and Embodied Carbon Emissions using Genetic Algortihms and later converting the meta-data to 
represent it as a Graph. This unique research represents a BIM model as Graph.

A blend of Revit API (C#, PyRevit), and Autodesk Platform Services helps optimize structures and reduce carbon emissions.

üìå Key Takeaways: 
‚Ä¢ Integrate Large Language Models with Revit and Autodesk Platform Services for smarter structural optimization.
‚Ä¢ Use graph databases like Neo4j for data handling.
‚Ä¢ Combine AI and programming to enhance structural engineering.


üí° Practical tips:
‚Üí Prepare BIM data using PyRevit and C# add-ins.
‚Üí Query Revit models with Autodesk Platform Services and GraphQL for precise data retrieval.
‚Üí Enhance AI models using knowledge graphs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).


üõ†Ô∏è Tools and technologies used:
‚Ä¢ Revit and Revit API
‚Ä¢ PyRevit
‚Ä¢ C#/.NET
‚Ä¢ Autodesk Platform Services (APS)
‚Ä¢ GraphQL
‚Ä¢ Neo4j (graph database)
‚Ä¢ Langchain (AI framework)
‚Ä¢ Karamba (Grasshopper plugin)
‚Ä¢ Rhino.Inside Revit

How Revit (and API) was used:
Revit served as the foundation for structural models optimized using AI. Custom add-ins extracted data and operated external databases.

How AI was used:
LLMs optimized structural models and enhanced data querying.
