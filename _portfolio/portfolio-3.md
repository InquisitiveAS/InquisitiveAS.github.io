As my first hackathon in the AEC FOSS Community(AEC Free Open Source Software development), I was more interested in the experience and
understanding the Full Stack Machine Learning Pipeline. It was a wonderful collaboration with talented developers and ideators of this hackathon
and to learn more from them. 

"AI2Speckle: Textures Search" is a React Web application which imports 3D models into Speckle 3D Object loaded, uses AI to generate renderings, extracts material patches from the renderings with some more AI, and reintegrates them back into the model."

Please vote and like for the project . You can find the project on Github
