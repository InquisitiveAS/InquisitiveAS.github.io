With AEC Tech eco-system constantly evolving, I have decided to start blogging my journey into AEC_SDE Space(AEC Software development Engineering)
to help the community of developers by giving away the resources I use in my day to day workflow.

AEC_SDE#1 is a short and comprehensive non-techical & design thinking blogs for architects turned software developers. I would recommend technical blogs, notion notebooks,software documentation by senior technical advocates in AEC Tech. Also look at API documentation for the same. Some of the one's which inspire me are:

1. Jonathon Broughton of Speckle.
2. Mayur Mistry of 3DGURU.AI.
3. Jeremy Tammik from Autodesk.
4. Ehsan Iran-Nejad of PyRevit.
5. Stjepan Mikulic of AIinAEC.
6. "Thank God It's Computational" by Vignesh Kaushik of Gensler.
7. Jean-Marc Couffin of PyRevit
8. Autodesk Research Blog.
9. Autodesk Revit API docs
10. RhinoCommon API docs.
11. Autodesk Forma docs.
12. That Open Company by 

Learn from the Best and Keep it Simple !
