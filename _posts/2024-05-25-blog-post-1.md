My journey transitioning from an Architectural designer in India to Computational Designer focused on BIM Application 
development in North America has taught me job roles are fluid and one must learn to adapt and improvise. With AEC
Tech eco-system constantly evolving, I have decided to start blogging my journey into AEC_SDE Space(AEC Software development Engineering)
to help the community of developers

AEC_SDE#1 is a short and comprehensive non-techical & design thinking blogs for architects turned software developers. I would recommend technical blogs, notion notebooks,software documentation by senior technical advocates like Jonathon Broughton of Speckle,
Mayur Mistry of 3DGURU.AI, Jeremy Tammik from Autodesk, Ehsan Iran-Nejad of PyRevit, Stjepan Mikulic of AIinAEC.

Learn from the Best and Keep it Simple !
